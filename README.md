# LTLControlSynthesis

This is the accompanying code for the paper "Zonotope-based Symbolic Controller Synthesis for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications" by Wei Ren, Raphael M. Jungers, and Dimos V. Dimarogonas. This code is to generate finite local controllers to achieve the global LTL task.

# How to run
You need to install [CORA](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/) for the zonotope generation and [SCOTS](https://gitlab.lrz.de/hcs/scots) for the abstraction construction. 

# Matlab objects
We have defined several Matlab objects in this repo, including
